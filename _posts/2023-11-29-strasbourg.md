Annually, the Bork group organizes a retreat, bringing together a blend of scientific discussions and team-building activities. The retreat unfolded in the picturesque city of Strasbourg, just a two-hour drive from Heidelberg or a three-hour train journey.

Wednesday morning was dedicated to travel arrangements, with some opting for the scenic train journey and others embarking on a car adventure (or rather other way around?). A tasty lunch awaited us at the hotel restaurant upon our arrival. The afternoon kicked off with the initial series of team-building activities. As evening descended, we immersed ourselves in the enchanting Strasbourg Christmas markets, captivated by the festive spirit and the array of dazzling displays.

The following day commenced with engaging scientific discussions, predominantly focusing on tools developed within the group. Lunch unfolded at the same location, seamlessly transitioning into a lively trivia session. The day's agenda also featured an outdoor activity akin to a scavenger hunt, culminating in a convivial dinner at a city-center restaurant.

On the concluding day, the morning was reserved for further discussions, a succinct wrap-up, and a final round of shared insights. Post-lunch, we embarked on our journey back to Heidelberg.
