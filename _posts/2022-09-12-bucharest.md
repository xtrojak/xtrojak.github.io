This year in September, I participated in the 20th International Conference on Computational Methods in Systems Biology ([CMSB 2022](https://fmi.unibuc.ro/en/cmsb-2022/)) at the Faculty of Biology, University of Bucharest, Romania. I had a [presentation](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xtrojak/files/presentations/cmsb2022.pdf) about our contribution _eBCSgen 2.0: Modelling and Analysis of Regulated Rule-based Systems_.

I travelled to Bucharest by plane from Vienna. I was accompanied by my colleagues Samuel and David, although we didn't have the same flights. Me and Samuel rented an apartment close to the city centre (Parliament & River View Apartments).

Except for attending the conference I had only a little time for sightseeing. Moreover, I was feeling ill the whole time. I have briefly seen the city centre and the building of the parliament, which was pretty close to the place we were staying.

We had a social dinner included in the conference. It was in [Hanu' Berarilor Casa Oprea Soare](https://hanuberarilor.ro/en/restaurants/casa_oprea_soare/) located close to the city center. Before that, there was a commented walking tour in the city centre, which I had to skip.
