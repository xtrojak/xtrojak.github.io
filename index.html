    <p>My name is <em>Matej Troj√°k</em> and I'm a researcher in systems biology.</p>
    <p>The primary focus of my research is the development of formalisms and computational tools in the field of Systems biology that support the modelling of biological systems. I'm particularly interested in approaches which allow answering crucial questions about studied system efficiently using an appropriate level of abstraction.</p>
    <p>I'm currently employed as a Planetary Biology Biocurator at EMBL on <a href="https://www.embl.org/about/info/trec/">TREC (Traversing European Coastlines) project</a>.</p>
